# What did you see on line 1?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
    # A line to print random number between 5 and 20 inclusive
    # The smallest number possible was 5 and the largest number possible was 20
import random

# What did you see on line 2?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Could line 2 have produced a 4?
    # A line to print a random number from a sequence in range of 3 to 10 with step count of 2
    # The smallest number possible was 5 and the largest number possible was 9
    # No, because the step count was 2 meaning the only possible numbers were 5, 7, or 9

# What did you see on line 3?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
    # A line to print random float point number (decimal) between 2.5 and 5.5 inclusive
    # The smallest number possible was 2.5 and the largest number possible was 5.5

# Write code, not a comment, to produce a random number between 1 and 100 inclusive.
