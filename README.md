# CP1404 Practicals
## Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

My name is Kennard Lim.  

This is a repository to store and refer to all the programs, texts, and files  
made by me for the completion of the practical sections requirement for the  
CP1404 subject.

The 3 main lessons I've learned about "clean code" in this subject are:  
- Use good naming convention and consistent spacing and indentation for clarity
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), which is the avoidance of code duplication redundancy
- Create and or refactor functions as needed, not everything has to be a function
