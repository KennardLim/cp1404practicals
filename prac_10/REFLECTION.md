# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Sort of accurate, id usually undershoot and practicals would take slightly longer than expected.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Not much, id keep underestimating how long it would take to do most practicals.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

You will always take longer to finish task than what you would first estimate, 
your first estimation usually doesn't account for possibility of slight mishaps or the thinking time,
your brain will usually imagine a perfect scenario at first glance giving you a shorter estimate.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I make a lot of very easily correctable accidents.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

People have varying ways of sorting their code and programming functionalities, 
sometimes id see a code that's very different from mine but would achieve the same result.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review 1 - Prac 05](https://github.com/juninhochandra/cp1404practicals/pull/1#event-16642149594)

### Explanation

Well I pointed out any bad naming conventions to the best of my understanding, and pointed out some
lines that didn't really align with best practices.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code Review 2 - Prac 06](https://github.com/juninhochandra/cp1404practicals/pull/2/files/c86c69dcfdbcb0122ef94f2628c0075e661b40e2#diff-bce9fe3f710a8d2edd79d3b43cc01cb8557b5f3f94b30755ccfa9a93419d79ac)

### Explanation

Not much to say here, checked his code and everything looked fine, though i did have to make a review so
i just pointed out a badly named variable and called it a day.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I'd probably make the workload a bit lighter especially for the practicals near the end of the semester, 
a lot of other subjects will be assigning a lot of work during this period and i t would preferable if
the practicals were more concentrated.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think i did pretty well on structuring code and following SRP, and i think my naming conventions were pretty good.
